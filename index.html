Retired projects:

* Robanukah <i>was</i> a search engine which scanned URLs for the /robots.txt file and stored all the "disallow" entries. It was great for finding hidden administration interfaces,
 internal company documents, passwords and other goodies. Today, you can just ask Google for something like <a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=disallow%3A+inurl%3A%2Frobots.txt+filetype%3Atxt+XLS">"disallow:" inurl:/robots.txt filetype:txt XLS</a> instead (for XLS spreadsheet).

* <a href="/openpath/">OpenPath</a>.rb <i>was</i> a ruby script for Microsoft Windows systems which would enumerate the registry for services which run as LocalSystem, which use unquoted paths. Unquoted paths can
 be abused to gain SYSTEM access / privesc. It also tested files where the path was correctly quoted, but the file itself had incorrect NTFS permissions which allows write access. In which case,
 an attacker could simply copy the executable, overwrite it with a malicious payload, start the service, then after privesc, reinstating the original executable.
