RemotelyAnywhere - Multiple Vulnerabilities

1. There is a service 'RAMaint' (probably a watchdog task). It runs as LocalSystem and uses an unsafe path in versions earlier than v8.

2. If authenticated, you can fetch log files via

/download/?dir=C:\Program%20Files\RemotelyAnywhere\&file=RemotelyAnywhere.log&pack=txt

Of course, you could change this to read files the server administrator had not necessarily intended.

3. There is an XSS in the custom RA HTTP service, which you can use to steal cookies. Of course, you need to entice your target to visit the address.
